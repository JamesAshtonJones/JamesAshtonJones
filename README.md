**Hi, I'm Ashton.**

Iâ€™m a Quantitative & Computational Finance and Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech.

I research and develop machine learning and quantitative models to understand risk, optimize portfolios, and analyze complex data sets. My work combines finance, statistics, and computation from modeling housing market ETFs and portfolio risk, to building data-driven tools for supply chain forecasting and energy modeling.
